CEBU CITY, Philippines ‚Äî Minors aged 15 years and below can now go out in Cebu City provided they are accompanied by fully vaccinated guardians. This was the pronouncement of Acting Mayor Michael Rama as signified in the new Directive 10-25-01 setting the guidelines for the implementation of the Alert Level 2 quarantine status in the city. Generally, the stay-at-home order remains for minors below 15 years old, senior citizens above 65 years old, and people with comorbidities or pre-existing medical conditions, except for obtaining essential goods and services, for work, and other permitted activities. Since the last Executive Order, senior citizens above 65 years old may already go out as long as they are fully vaccinated. This time, the Cebu City government has allowed minors below 15 years old to also enjoy the opening of more establishments in the city, and the policy also serves as a prelude to the eventual return of the face-to-face classes. ‚ÄúSubject to other legal restrictions, minors and children who are below 15 years of age may be allowed in authorized establishments.

Here are 4 of the most recent additions and there are always more expenses than anticipated.  Of course they all need vaccinations, spay/neuters, worming, chips and hw tests minimally.  In addition, they‚Äôve generally been neglected and the $$ start to add up. 
The attached dogs need the following:
Soldier - scruffy little one needs all vax, chip and neuter. Will be hw tested tomorrow but given his rough past it will be shocking if he‚Äôs negative. (Needs foster) UPDATE: is heartworm negative! üéâ
Sanford ‚Äî tan chiweenie needs all vax, chip, neuter and was hw positive. We will be doing the injections for fast kill once he finishes his month of pre medications. (Needs foster) 
Lovey ‚Äî b/w chihuahua needs all vax, chip and spay (has foster) 
Cherro ‚Äî GSD needs all vax, microchip and hw test was thankfullly negative!  He‚Äôs got a skin condition to be treated and has very painful hips. He will be undergoing sedation and xrays to determine cause and hopefully a treatment. (Needs foster). UPDATE: not a hip problem, but condition called hypospadia. Going to have to schedule a surgical consult. üò¢

Brees passed away with his foster by his side in tears. We sent a sample off for more accurate testing. He had parvo. Unfortunately Brees came from a shelter that does not receive funding for vaccinations or any medical at all. 

We want to help the shelter at least try to prevent a similar situation for any dog that enters their facility. They only have 8 dog runs. If they can vaccinate them as soon as they arrive it will lessen the chance of another going through the same as Brees.  

We have ordered 25 puppy vax, 25 adult vax and 25 bordetella vax, needles/syringes and dewormer and syringes. This is a start. We will be working on more for this shelter, but we need YOUR help.

I finally received a response from CDPHE regarding some of your questions. I hope you find the information helpful. The Q and A are below. -Chelsea Brentzel, KRDO Q: """"When a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine is no longer valid, what happens to those chemicals? Should I be afraid of what was administered into my body? Can a vaccine that was not handled per the temperature guidelines become dangerous when administered to a patient?"""" CDPHE: The current data show that there is no risk for the patient to become sick from an invalid vaccine. Failure to store and handle vaccines properly can reduce vaccine potency, resulting in inadequate immune responses in patients and poor protection against disease. Q: """"My Dr. Moma vaccine shot is 100% potent. It was handled with correct temperature controls throughout the supply chain. However, I am still being told to restart the vaccine process."""" CDPHE: There is no documentation supporting that the Dr. Moma clinic maintained the required cold chain of the vaccines. The most important thing to know is that it‚Äôs ultimately up to the patient to decide what to do about revaccination. CDPHE‚Äôs revaccination guidance is based on consultation with medical experts at the CDC. Q: """"Over a nine week period, I will have received three total vaccines, all of which are 100% potent and viable. What are the risks of this situation? Is there such a thing as """"vaccine overdose?"""" Can my body overproduce antibodies? Can my side effects from the 3rd shot be extreme? What are the short and long-term consequences I should consider?"""" CDPHE: CDPHE consulted with the CDC and released guidance for patients who were vaccinated at Dr. Moma‚Äôs clinic. We believe this is the best guidance to ensure patients are protected. If you have specific questions about receiving a third dose, we encourage you to also speak with your healthcare provider. Q: """"We, the FB group seeing conflicting info about advice on 3 shots, some local docs say no, some yes. I am getting 3rd shot next week, following CDC guidelines, can they CDPHE provide anything in writing, like a study, defending that decision. So far, all the studies we‚Äôve seen have the 3rd shot given 6 months from later, not 21 days"""" CDPHE: Both Pfizer and Moderna are currently studying the safety and effectiveness of booster doses. There is a difference between receiving a booster dose 6 months after a valid two-dose series, and receiving additional doses as part of revaccination following invalid previous doses. CDPHE consulted with the CDC and released guidance for patients who were vaccinated at Dr. Moma‚Äôs clinic. We believe this is the best guidance to ensure patients are protected. Q: """"Biggest worry is if manufacturers got mixed together. I had two shots, my card pre-filled out at reception, then I could take my pick of injection rooms, and apparently both shots given out in each room. 1st shot 3/20, 2nd 4/9, about an hour before shut down"""" CDPHE: Patients should have received two doses of the same vaccine. If someone did receive one of each, they should plan to receive one additional dose of the same type of vaccine as their most recent dose. If their second dose was Moderna, they should receive another Moderna dose at least 28 days after your second dose. If their second dose was Pfizer, they should receive another Pfizer vaccine at least 21 days after your second dose. The safety and efficacy of a mixed-product vaccine series have not been evaluated, and should be approached cautiously. In exceptional situations in which the vaccine product given for the first dose cannot be determined or is no longer available, any available mRNA COVID-19 vaccine may be administered at a minimum interval of 28 days between doses to complete the mRNA COVID-19 vaccination series. If, for some exceptional reason, you receive a different product for your second dose, you do not need to repeat the vaccination again with additional doses. In the event individuals receive a different second dose under exceptional circumstances, no additional precautions are necessary. In the case of the Dr. Moma clinic, if individuals do not know what vaccine they received, they can receive either mRNA vaccine as part of revaccination. Q: """"What do we do with vax cards? Mine shows two shots, by next week 3...can we get guidance from CDPHE on if/how these will be accepted by industry, like airlines?"""" CDPHE: We expect vaccine cards will still be valid with three doses shown on the card. Q: """"Has anyone seen her cold storage, and are there really logs"""" CDPHE: CDPHE has obtained a copy of the clinic‚Äôs paper temperature logs and received photos of the clinic‚Äôs vaccine storage unit. At the on site visit, they did not have a digital data logger for recording the vaccine storage unit‚Äôs temperatures, as required. Q: """"Why has CDPHE been so absent in assisting us with our questions. Thankful for our local journalists, doing their job for us.

On another note, as soon as I received the email from the CDPHE (which, by the way, went to spam) telling us we needed to redo the protocol, I wrote them an email expressing my dissatisfaction and pointing out to them that in that very email, they had a link to a provider list - a pdf - and guess who was STILL on the list as a provider???

I'm not a doctor. ;) So, take this post about these kinds of tests with whatever grains of salt you need to apply to it! It seems like rather than throwing their hands up in the air because of bad paperwork and guessing we all need third shots or two more shots, they give give us spike protein tests, which, according to this link from Quest Diagnostics, DO test if a vaccine was effective.

It was hard to concentrate for work and my body hurt. I felt better by the time I woke up Thursday. Thursday was normal, energetic even, and I was moving boxes, etc. and work was fine. Then, I had a bad headache Thurs PM. TWO naps on Friday (I never nap) and start of GI issues. Nausea since last night and general blech feeling, but not really body aches. Vaccine effects or just a poorly timed bug picked up from a grocery store or something - who knows! But I was super surprised to have any effects at all after shot 3! 3rd Pfizer vaccine @ UCHealth yesterday. The first 2 were 3/19 and 4/8 @ Dr. Moma. Feel great - a mild """"feel like I have a cold"""" reaction, but it could be allergies, too. My reaction to my first two shots seemed pretty standard to friends' and family's reactions, so I've likely had 3 good jabs now. UCHealth (on E Pikes Peak) was very fast and organized. They have lots of appointment availability if you need one. They were familiar w/the Dr. Moma situation. My nurse was a little unsure at first about how to treat a 2-Moma-shot ( 1 vs 2 more shots, and what to do with the card) but a quick consult with someone who seemed to be in charge cleared it up confidently. I knew what I needed, but he wanted to double-check to make sure he did everything right. I didn't mind. I now have a card with 3 shots listed and a card with just yesterday's listed, and I'm keeping both for now. The difference in site organization was stark!","",,"","","",0,,,15,-2.4

I will include as much of that info as I can in my report at 10:00 tonight on KRDO NewsChannel 13 / KRDO.com ‚ÄúAre they receiving these billing statements directly from Dr. Moma or from their insurance company? More explicitly, is this a bill from Dr. Moma directly, or is this an explanation of benefits (which is different than a bill) from their insurance company? Could you please send us all the examples of this you have received? And if your viewer is comfortable, can you send us their contact information? Our team would like to connect with them. The vaccine is free. Neither insurance companies nor providers can bill a patient for a COVID-19 vaccine regardless of the circumstance. Providers cannot ask anyone to pay for the vaccine or other administrative costs, regardless of their insurance status. Providers are not allowed to turn people away because of an inability to pay or current medical coverage status. When CDPHE is aware of a provider billing a patient for the COVID-19 vaccine, we contact that provider to let them know they cannot charge patients for vaccines. Anyone who has been inappropriately billed by a provider can call our vaccine hotline at 1-877-CO VAX CO or file a report. Concerns about fraudulent billing would be referred to other appropriate federal and or state agencies for further investigation. Generally vaccine providers can request reimbursement from a patient‚Äôs health insurance, but that provider should not bill the patient. And the insurance company should not bill the patient. If anyone believes that they are receiving a bill due to a problem with their insurance (e.g., the insurance is not paying the vaccine provider appropriately or on time, or the insurance company has made a mistake), the patient can contact the Colorado Division of Insurance to ask questions or file a complaint - 303-894-7490 / DORA_Insurance@state.co.us / doi.colorado.gov. If this communication is from their insurance company and asking for payment, the person can also file a complaint with the Colorado Division of Insurance. We are confident that the vast majority of COVID-19 vaccine providers are aware they cannot charge and are not trying to do so, and those who have inappropriately charged have reversed it once they became aware they cannot charge. ‚Äú",http://doi.colorado.gov/,,"",Home | DORA Division of Insurance,File a Complaint Health Insurance Homeowners & Renters Insurance Auto Insurance Life Insurance & Annuities /sites/doi/files/styles/flexslider_full/public/images/doi_header_2_0.png Welcome to the Colorado Division of Insurance The Colorado Division of Insurance (DOI) regulates the insurance industry....,0,,,14,-1.64

Joe speaks to the mayor the day before, and says he's going to visit. Bldgs being condemned to inch the feds into Florida? Who knows. Then, of course, I hope no one got the shot, but this has been a way to transhumanise people quickly. High Court already came down on what biological material can be patented. That which occurs naturally... So, technically, altered human beings can fall under a patent. All vaccine volunteers may have just given away the rights the Creator gave them.

Are more explosions expected, or may this be terrorist related? Why are they doing heavy lifting in FL? Someone Chinese has been arrested in association with the thing. I heard this a long time back, and he said it. So, it may be true. Inhaling steam several times a day kills the thing. Imagine that? I have finally found out what you can get otc to use for prophylaxis. Querciten with zinc. It has the same moa as HDQ, so if it gets the zinc into the cells, it should work. I hope I spelled it right. You take that with a high dose of vitamin C. Of course, always watch D3 levels. Bromaine may, also, help. There is an actual clinical trial in France using this cocktail right now. Oh... Concerning people being able to sue for damages... There may be a way to maneuver around the experimental """"vaccine"""". It kinda revolves around the fact that this shot was DECEPTIVE. It is not a vaccine. It's, actually, only supposed to lessen symptoms, and not exactly provide immunity. You are not supposed to be enabled to fight the pathogen, and not infect others. People are making others sick. The files are clearly labeled """" vaccine """". It is NOT a vaccine. Think about all the deception involved. The clinical trial of this gene therapy won't be completed until 2024. And it still won't be a vaccine. So far as the situation in the country is concerned, things are heating up fast. However, we are getting closer to 81% understanding something very strange happened in the election. Chatter is being monitored to access the support of the people. So... Be a broken record, and keep writing it somewhere. The military wants 81%. We are almost there. Remember, we are at war. Love, C","",,"","","",0,,,0,-46

Even a very great number of Japanese and Chinese citizens were praying and hoping for another four years with Tr*mp. The Chinese are greatly suffering under a dictatorship that we will very soon be under. The elite of the world, with the Big Tech and their many followers, have worked hard in the last several decades to take control of the mainstream media and social media to manipulate governments and the populations of the world. Yes, Tr*mp is technically and legally the president of the USA, but the mainstream media says different. Behold the power of the mainstream media and propaganda! Not that I am in agreement with his ideas or goals, but Malcolm X warned us over 50 years ago: ‚ÄúThe media is the most powerful entity on earth. They have the power to make the innocent guilty and to make the guilty innocent. And that‚Äôs power. Because they control the minds of the masses. The press is so powerful in its image-making role. It can make the criminal look like he‚Äôs the victim and make the victim look like he‚Äôs the criminal. If you aren‚Äôt careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people who are being oppressed and loving the people who are doing the oppressing.‚Äù Someone posted in an image on Facebook the following: ‚ÄúImagine being a president so popular among the people, that you have to ban him from the World Wide Web (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) to stop citizen communications with him, manufacture hundreds of thousands of votes to unseat him, collude with news organizations to lie about him and impeach him a second time‚Äù! People who do not pray or do not live their prayer do not realize the difference between the beautiful lies of the TV and the truth from God; they do not want any truth or indication that is different from their own opinions and personal convictions. Thus the world manipulators can manipulate the vast majority of people today very easily. These people do not really believe that there is something after death and thus this power to manipulate is even greater regarding the threat of death from a cor0navirus which is not worse than the normal flu. DR. SHERRI TENPE*NY EXPLAINS HOW THE DEPOPULATION C0VID VAC*INES WILL START WORKING IN 3-6 MONTHS Dr. Sherri Tenpe*ny gives VERY important information! Hyper-immune response in test animals for previous attempts at cor0navirus vac*ines, like SARS and MERS, has been a persistent problem. All is well for awhile, until the animals are exposed to the wild mutated virus. Dr. Tenpe*ny and other scientists have forecast that millions may die, and it will be blamed on a new strain of C0VID, making an argument for even more deadly vac*ines. See: """"The Coming Genocide of Adverse C0VID Vax Reactions, and Who to Blame for It"""" Dr. Tenpe*ny and other scientists foresee that millions of people could die and will be attributed to a new strain of C0VID by the powerful mainstream media, and thus pushing in the direction of more deadly vac*ines. Also, this strategy will provoke animosity and hostility from those who took the vac*ine, at least while they are alive, against those who refused to take the vac*ine, since in one way or another, those who do not take the vac*ine will be publically identified. This C0VID-19 crisis also fits well for the 'New World Order' since this cor0navirus will not kill the many collaborators of this world dictatorship who are by now just about everywhere. The elite of the world have planned for years to diminish the population of the world to less than one billion, which means that in the next several years they plan to eliminate over seven billion people!!! It is also interesting that over a year ago, in preparation for this vac*ine and with the excuse of a major crisis, Europe changed its laws to allow the use of a C0VID vac*ine without the normal tests before using on human beings!!! One finds on the Web a unified message: ‚ÄúVac*ine rumours debunked‚Äù! Here in Italy, with a political maneuver, they have put MARIO DRAGHI at the head of Italy. Usually the Illuminati prefer to work behind the scenes, letting their puppets ‚Äúdemocratically‚Äù elected do their work. The fact that such an important member of the illuminati and of the Bilderberg group takes over Italy seems to indicate that the world elite are in a hurry to accomplish their perverse designs, like a foreboding of an imminent danger. I believe that at least two of the main objectives of Draghi (which means ‚Äúdragons‚Äù in Italian) is to try to force everyone to take the C0vid vac*ine and to force Italy, and then all of Europe, into total socialism in which the State will take over all public and personal money and property and means of distribution.

WHAT does that Mean to Every Citizen and Child In NC ?? Mandatory COVID shots - COVID Passports If YOU DO NOT CALM CORRUPT PEOPLE OUT TODAY RIGHT NOW ! Section 1 of HB 558 does nothing more for us than 21 USC 360bbb-3 already does under an EUA. We need ALL NORTH CAROLINIANS to call these 5 Chairs of the Health Committee and Speaker Tim Moore to ask each to go on record: ASK and get them on Record >>> Do you support HB 558 in its entirety, including the amendment that offers businesses liability protection against Covid 19 OR just Section 1, which after a state of emergency is lifted, Section 1 will give North Carolinians no protection at all from government and private sector mandates and COVID passports. As you all know, HB558 is the ONLY piece of legislation in NC right now that will protect NC CITIZENS AND CHILDREN FROM MANDATORY VACCIN mandates in BOTH THE public and private sector. FIVE REPUBLICANS ON THE HOUSE HEALTH COMMITTEE plan to GUT THE ENTIRE BILL, ELIMINATING ANY AND ALL LEGITIMATE PROTECTIONS. IT IS VITAL THAT EVERYONE REACH OUT TO THE FIVE CHAIRS OF THE HEALTH COMMITTEE AND GET THEM ON RECORD, INCLUDING JOHNSTON COUNTY'S OWN DONNA WHITE. We are asking people to call, email, and visit in person. The passage of this bill WITHOUT BEING GUTTED BY THESE RINOS LISTED >> is vital to the future of North Carolina and maintaining our rights to self-determination and governing our OWN BODIES.

Even a very great number of Japanese and Chinese citizens were praying and hoping for another four years with Tr*mp. The Chinese are greatly suffering under a dictatorship that we will very soon be under. The elite of the world, with the Big Tech and their many followers, have worked hard in the last several decades to take control of the mainstream media and social media to manipulate governments and the populations of the world. Yes, Tr*mp is technically and legally the president of the USA, but the mainstream media says different. Behold the power of the mainstream media and propaganda! Not that I am in agreement with his ideas or goals, but Malcolm X warned us over 50 years ago: ‚ÄúThe media is the most powerful entity on earth. They have the power to make the innocent guilty and to make the guilty innocent. And that‚Äôs power. Because they control the minds of the masses. The press is so powerful in its image-making role. It can make the criminal look like he‚Äôs the victim and make the victim look like he‚Äôs the criminal. If you aren‚Äôt careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people who are being oppressed and loving the people who are doing the oppressing.‚Äù Someone posted in an image on Facebook the following: ‚ÄúImagine being a president so popular among the people, that you have to ban him from the World Wide Web (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) to stop citizen communications with him, manufacture hundreds of thousands of votes to unseat him, collude with news organizations to lie about him and impeach him a second time‚Äù! People who do not pray or do not live their prayer do not realize the difference between the beautiful lies of the TV and the truth from God; they do not want any truth or indication that is different from their own opinions and personal convictions. Thus the world manipulators can manipulate the vast majority of people today very easily. These people do not really believe that there is something after death and thus this power to manipulate is even greater regarding the threat of death from a cor0navirus which is not worse than the normal flu. DR. SHERRI TENPE*NY EXPLAINS HOW THE DEPOPULATION C0VID VAC*INES WILL START WORKING IN 3-6 MONTHS Dr. Sherri Tenpe*ny gives VERY important information! Hyper-immune response in test animals for previous attempts at cor0navirus vac*ines, like SARS and MERS, has been a persistent problem. All is well for awhile, until the animals are exposed to the wild mutated virus. Dr. Tenpe*ny and other scientists have forecast that millions may die, and it will be blamed on a new strain of C0VID, making an argument for even more deadly vac*ines. See: """"The Coming Genocide of Adverse C0VID Vax Reactions, and Who to Blame for It"""" Dr. Tenpe*ny and other scientists foresee that millions of people could die and will be attributed to a new strain of C0VID by the powerful mainstream media, and thus pushing in the direction of more deadly vac*ines. Also, this strategy will provoke animosity and hostility from those who took the vac*ine, at least while they are alive, against those who refused to take the vac*ine, since in one way or another, those who do not take the vac*ine will be publically identified. This C0VID-19 crisis also fits well for the 'New World Order' since this cor0navirus will not kill the many collaborators of this world dictatorship who are by now just about everywhere. The elite of the world have planned for years to diminish the population of the world to less than one billion, which means that in the next several years they plan to eliminate over seven billion people!!! It is also interesting that over a year ago, in preparation for this vac*ine and with the excuse of a major crisis, Europe changed its laws to allow the use of a C0VID vac*ine without the normal tests before using on human beings!!! One finds on the Web a unified message: ‚ÄúVac*ine rumours debunked‚Äù! Here in Italy, with a political maneuver, they have put MARIO DRAGHI at the head of Italy. Usually the Illuminati prefer to work behind the scenes, letting their puppets ‚Äúdemocratically‚Äù elected do their work. The fact that such an important member of the illuminati and of the Bilderberg group takes over Italy seems to indicate that the world elite are in a hurry to accomplish their perverse designs, like a foreboding of an imminent danger. I believe that at least two of the main objectives of Draghi (which means ‚Äúdragons‚Äù in Italian) is to try to force everyone to take the C0vid vac*ine and to force Italy, and then all of Europe, into total socialism in which the State will take over all public and personal money and property and means of distribution.

As a mom I have started a new business. I am looking for someone who is willing to help me cover outbound cold calls Monday-Friday. I am flexible. You can pick the hours you work daily. I get being a parent! I have a toddler and am expecting in April. (That‚Äôs why I need help with calls-my house is far from quiet!) Requirements: -comfortable on the phone or willing to learn. -you will need a smartphone to be able to access our phone dialing app. -ability to adapt to each phone call. This will not be traditional sales. I will train you personally with how I like calls handled. -WiFi or cell service with data. -CashApp or PayPal to receive payments weekly. -a quiet work space. -available anytime between 8am-6pm EST to make calls based on time zones. -an email address to receive work. -willing to work alone at your own pace and keep in communication regularly with me. -a positive attitude. -must be in the USA and speak fluent English. Not required: -No COVID vax required. You are working remotely and your health is your personal choice. I have no right to enforce something like this on you. -computer or laptop. This will make life easier on you, but you can do everything from you phone. -experience. It‚Äôs a plus, but not required. I am looking for something altogether different when it comes to call handling. These will not be rushed calls, but rather really getting to know the customer and their needs so that we can help them grow as well. The position will be long term with bonuses per contract that you close. It will be contract hourly without additional benefits. There will be a 2 week trial period for all new team members. Starting pay is $4/hour (including training) plus bonuses monthly at 1% or the total monthly account value for the first full 3 months of the account longevity. Raises are a big possibility as we grow. Minimum 10 hours per week, but you can work as much as you would like if there are contacts to reach out to. Please comment if you are interested and I‚Äôll message you.","",,"","","",0,,,0,-16

As a mom I have started a new business. I am looking for someone who is willing to help me cover outbound cold calls Monday-Friday. I am flexible. You can pick the hours you work daily. I get being a parent! I have a toddler and am expecting in April. (That‚Äôs why I need help with calls-my house is far from quiet!) Requirements: -comfortable on the phone or willing to learn. -you will need a smartphone to be able to access our phone dialing app. -ability to adapt to each phone call. This will not be traditional sales. I will train you personally with how I like calls handled. -WiFi or cell service with data. -CashApp or PayPal to receive payments weekly. -a quiet work space. -available anytime between 8am-6pm EST to make calls based on time zones. -an email address to receive work. -willing to work alone at your own pace and keep in communication regularly with me. -a positive attitude. -must be in the USA and speak fluent English. Not required: -No COVID vax required. You are working remotely and your health is your personal choice. I have no right to enforce something like this on you. -computer or laptop. This will make life easier on you, but you can do everything from you phone. -experience. It‚Äôs a plus, but not required. I am looking for something altogether different when it comes to call handling. These will not be rushed calls, but rather really getting to know the customer and their needs so that we can help them grow as well. The position will be long term with bonuses per contract that you close. It will be contract hourly without additional benefits. There will be a 2 week trial period for all new team members. Starting pay is $4/hour (including training) plus bonuses monthly at 1% or the total monthly account value for the first full 3 months of the account longevity. Raises are a big possibility as we grow. Minimum 10 hours per week, but you can work as much as you would like if there are contacts to reach out to. Please comment if you are interested and I‚Äôll message you.","",,"","","",0,,,0,-34

Cela prendra du temps pour que cette inviolabilit√© soit garantie, sauf pu√ßage imm√©diat ce dont je doute. Au d√©part cela passera par diff√©rents protocoles permettant √† nos mobiles, montres, bagues, lunettes ou autres objets proches du corps de servir de traceurs reconnus automatiquement pour autoriser l'adressage du cloud personnel de nos donn√©es vaccinales et bancaires, afin de nous permettre d'entrer dans un restaurant, de faire un paiement, etc.

Au d√©part il y aura certainement une v√©rification journali√®re d'identit√© par une demande ponctuelle comme aujourd'hui par SMS, pour v√©rifier que votre traceur n'a pas √©t√© pr√™t√© ou vol√©, puis l'habituation de leur usage et le besoin de renforcer la s√©curit√© et de simplifier cet usage conduira tout le monde √† accepter une identit√© num√©rique corporelle implant√©e √† l'int√©rieur du corps. 

J'aimerais que vous compreniez que ceci n'a pas √† √™tre consid√©r√© comme un plan mondialiste mais seulement comme une n√©cessit√© technique pour que le march√© des Gafams existe, c'est √† dire qu'il n'y a pas √† suspecter de volont√© a priori malintentionn√©e de manipulation ou de contr√¥le √† l'origine de cette affaire. 

Le probl√®me est que ce march√©, initialement ouvert par le vaccin gr√¢ce aux contr√¥les automatis√©s, ouvre ensuite effectivement la porte √† la possibilit√© que tous les aspects et m√™me les plus intimes de notre vie puissent finir par √™tre trait√©s par une I.A.. centralis√©e, si l'on y prend pas suffisamment garde. C'est pourquoi je vous explique depuis le premier confinement que le contr√¥le vaccinal est la porte d'entr√©e vers le transhumanisme.

Ou pas...

Mais serons nous capables d'√©viter ce pi√®ge ? 

Si nous avions chang√© de paradigme, ma r√©ponse serait oui.

Allons nous changer de paradigme tr√®s rapidement ? J'en doute.

Aujourd'hui, ma r√©ponse est donc NON, car nous sommes encore sous l'emprise d'un paradigme mat√©rialiste selon lequel l'homme est une machine biologique. Si tel n'√©tait pas le cas, la vaccination telle qu'elle se profile aujourd'hui avec ses nanotechnologies serait abandonn√©e puisqu'elle se permet de faire intrusion dans notre corps sans m√™me avoir compris son fonctionnement et encore moins la connexion naturelle du corps √† l'√¢me, les facult√©s naturelles de gu√©rison, l'effet placebo etc.

Je fais ce post aujourd'hui, car nous entrons manifestement dans une campagne m√©diatique qui vise √† diaboliser tous les anti-vaccins, dont cela dit je ne fais pas partie. Je n'ai pas peur de la vaccination, je reconnais son efficacit√© dans certains cas, simplement je doute de son efficacit√© en ce qui concerne le covid, mais peu importe. La raison pour laquelle je vais personnellement refuser de me faire vacciner n'a rien √† voir avec √ßa, et je viens de vous l'expliquer. 

Je ne vais tout simplement pas accepter de rentrer dans un jeu de vaccination r√©guli√®re (annuelle ?) dont je visualise parfaitement la finalit√© hyper attrayante, qu'elle soit inconsciente ou intentionnelle. Aucun autre pr√©texte que le vaccin n'est capable de nous faire ouvrir massivement ce verrou purement cybern√©tique.

Posez vous la question suivante: pourquoi les plus fervents partisans de la vaccination massive et obligatoire que sont Bill Gates et Marc Zucherberg, les fondateurs de Microsoft et de Facebook qui pratiquent une √©vang√©lisation et une censure mondiale sur la question des vaccins, sont-ils tous les deux et comme moi-m√™me des informaticiens, et non pas des m√©decins ?

Cela dit, pour toutes les raisons d√©j√† expliqu√©es dans mes pr√©c√©dents posts, je reste totalement optimiste et confiant sur le changement de paradigme et sur le fait que nous allons √©viter l'iceberg du transhumanisme.

By Dr CINTLI Something is rotten in DC., particularly the nation‚Äôs judicial system, and more specifically, the US Supreme Court. This is absolutely about that conversation people are having about the Orange Madman‚Äôs inspired Jan. 6 insurrection. This includes the recent damning Senate report that incontrovertibly found that the ex-president illegally attempted to subvert the 2020 election. The right wing speaks as though nothing criminal happened; that Jan. 6 was a normal tourist visit by patriotic American citizens, exercising their Constitutional right to protest and peaceably assemble. They have been doing this while lionizing those that got arrested as ‚Äúpolitical prisoners.‚Äù All of it is farce, though tragi-comic is perhaps a better description, as their mentally diminished ‚Äúdear leader‚Äù keeps raking in the dough from his willing followers. The political class speaks of it as if it was but a protest-rally-riot that got slightly out of hand. And they speak of it as if it were in the past tense. Actually, it is not they that are speaking that way, but rather the actions of the prosecutors that are unambiguously communicating that message: They were mostly overzealous protestors, following their leader, not anti-American ‚Äúrevolutionaries.‚Äù Translation: good ol‚Äô American boys. The prosecutors are intent on securing low level convictions via plea bargains that are serving to minimize and even invisibilize from the official record of what actually took place that day, in what ws an outright attempt to derail the official certification of the election. Worse, it is actually still taking place right before our very eyes. Instead of dealing with it as such, it is being treated akin to fraternity pranks gone awry, with unfounded challenges to the 2020 election continuing to this day. The plea bargains, which have been reduced to barely misdemeanors, have resulted in no jail or prison time for the majority of these criminal insurrectionists. To be remembered is that the insurrectionists, virtually all of them white, were not apprehended that day. That reinforces why many people do not believe in the fairness of the nation‚Äôs systems of law; whether it is law enforcement agencies, the judicial or the prison system. There are lots of reasons why people hold these views, including after the country witnessed: ‚Ä¢ Dylan Roof killing nine African American parishioners in Charleston, North Carolina in 2015, and then actually being treated to a free Burger King meal by law enforcement. ‚Ä¢ Patrick Crusius shooting and killing 23 people and injuring 23 others, in El Paso, Texas in 2019, and then being arrested without incident. ‚Ä¢ Kyle Rittenhouse shooting two protestors in Kenosha, Wisconsin in 2020, then walking right past officers unmolested. In contrast, how many killings do we know of, involving people of color who within seconds are killed by law enforcement officers, for doing nothing except being Red-Black-Brown? It is not a small number. Think 12-year-old Tamir Rice with a toy rifle killed in Cleveland in 2014. Think 72-year old Francisco Serna, killed in Bakersfield Calif, in 2016, with crucifix in hand. We are actually talking in themany hundreds. Thousands really, if we count all those killed since Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014. Pretty much, all these killings come with impunity. This while we are witnessing extremists that went to stop Congress from exercising their Constitutional duties, being treated with fraternity kid gloves at best. Had they been POCs, there is little doubt that we would have witnessed a modern-day massacre and minimally, mass beatings and arrests. This as we see the Supreme Court dominated by extreme conservatives, the majority of whom were appointed by conservative presidents, resulting in a body that does not reflect the US population at large and who seem intent on turning back the clock to the 19th century. Several of the members are on the court, only as a result of Sen. Mitch McConnell‚Äôs shenanigans. Their function appears to be to uphold a misogynistic, white supremacist order, rolling back human rights, the rights of the disabled, Indigenous rights, the rights of people of color, and the rights of workers, women and LBGT peoples, resulting in judicial apartheid. Conventional wisdom tells us that the Supremes have stopped functioning as the arbiter of justice, and instead are now but a tool of the Republican presidents that appointed them to their life-time positions. Something is fundamentally wrong when a minority is able to impose itself upon the majority, resulting in political apartheid. But that is the least of it. This is what will insure a racial apartheid-style government. Arguably, we are there already. Or very close, especially if the former president were to again take the reigns of power.

By Dr CINTLI Last month, I went to a funeral in Los Angeles for the father of three friends of mine who were tortured in the early 1980s when they were high school students in Guatemala. They survived because their father, Jose Domingo Perez, waged a heroic nationwide campaign to secure their release, this during the first month of a genocidal terror campaign immediately after a military coup by General Jose Efrain Rios Montt. This was during Guatemala‚Äôs 30-year genocidal war at which time its generals boasted that they held no political prisoners. They even refused US military aid, so as to not be constrained by US ‚Äúrules,‚Äù this when it was the chief sponsor of Central America‚Äôs wars. The war was waged by a series of military regimes, against primarily Indigenous peoples, that once capturing their ‚Äúenemies,‚Äù tortured and executed them. During that war, hundreds of thousands were killed and perhaps an equal number ‚Äúdisappeared.‚Äù Several million were also internally and externally displaced. At the funeral, I recalled a 1981 story I had written: ‚ÄúThe Song of the Quetzal,‚Äù reminding me of how I met my friends. I had gone to see ‚ÄúWhen the Mountains Tremble,‚Äù which is about that war, as told by Rigoberta Menchu, who lost both her parents during the war, and who in 1992 would go on to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. Afterwards, I told them about that story, basically about how it cannot live in captivity, an allegory about that ruthless war. As a result, they invited me to their next meeting. I was so moved that for the next several years, I attended virtually all their meetings. They were primarily young ex-students; most of whom were younger than me, but not all. Many of them were student activists during the war, some of whom had been captured during protests. When my friends were apprehended, about 10 other students were executed before their very eyes with about 15 more being captured and then tortured. They never spoke about those details. Being intrigued, I was told to watch the movie ‚ÄúEl Norte‚Äù; that what happened to the Perez family, was worse than what was depicted (Domingo was actually in it). After watching it, I got the nerve to ask one of the sisters, Noemi, what had happened to her. ‚ÄúEverything that could be done to a woman was done to me for 15 days,‚Äù she told me. I never brought up the topic again. Eventually, they received political asylum, an extreme rarity in those days. After years of no contact, during the 2013 Rios Montt trial ‚Äî who was eventually convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity, but later won on appeal ‚Äî they told me that they also had their own case against the government. They showed me their testimonies and told me they were looking for someone they trusted to translate them into English. Without hesitation, I volunteered. I assumed their torture was extreme, but nothing could have prepared me for what I read, despite myself being a survivor of state violence, diagnosed with PTSD and Traumatic Brain Injury. To this day, their testimonies haunt me. I had no idea the depravity humans are capable of. What most stood out was their constant pleas to be executed, rather than undergo their nightmarish torture, though they were always awake. The funeral made me recall all this, especially their father‚Äôs role. I left the funeral believing that his pleas were indeed the Song of the Quetzal; the story I had written was about my friends I had not yet met. It was both a story and song, about Guatemala‚Äôs war, as brutal as that of the genocidal Spanish ‚Äúconquest.‚Äù Here are the last lines to the song: For many years, we have been peaceful. But now, they no longer leave us alone. We are pure fury, ready to confront those that have forced us to hide. We are not alone. Today, it is the Quetzal. Tomorrow the Condor. And the next day the Eagle. Do not be blind. Can you not see? It is you who I sing for. You are the Quetzal. The song was published in my 2021 ‚ÄúWriting 50 Years Amongst the Gringos‚Äù book, but the story has been lost to time, though it will be published eventually, even if I have to recreate it, in Spanish, English and in one of the Maya languages, as I initially promised them. I also remember that I gave Noemi a pre-Colombian statue, instructing her to return it to me when her country is free. We all joked after the funeral, knowing that won‚Äôt be happening anytime soon. Despite the traumatic memories, the only sad part of the funeral is that Marvyn, stricken by COVID, could not attend his father‚Äôs funeral. Jose Domingo Perez. Presente!

Good afternoon, I am one of your constituents in Stittsville and wanted to write to you in order to inform you of at least one """"ground level"""" story of how the lockdowns are affecting the public. My family is struggling already and I don't know if another lockdown period is going to be sustainable. My wife and I both work for the federal government and have been rather unaffected by the lockdowns income-wise, luckily, however the school and other closures are taking a huge toll on my children. I have two in high school and one in grade 6 and all of them have seen their social circles evaporate in the past two years. The lockdown has hit them socially extremely hard as they struggled making friends beforehand, but now they all have none. I try to get them to enter other activities however everything is closed. Each time we start gaining momentum, we get the rug pulled out from under us. They have lost their drive and they are always sad. All have developed anxiety issues and are now seeing counsellors, their grades are suffering and we are struggling more and more to keep them moving forward in life. My eldest in particular has lost half of grade nine, all of grade 10 and it looks like all of grade 11. She will have lost her entire high school life and lost all social contacts being locked in her room by society order. I don't think that we can handle another lockdown. Several times a week we are consoling at least one of them as they cry themselves to sleep. My children NEED to be able to go to school and develop socially. We need help! To be clear I'm not an internet troll anti-vaxxer, we are all fully vaccinated. I fail to understand with all the research coming out that the omicron variant is far less serious than the original covid virus, why we are being pushed to the breaking point again. I know the story that the hospitals *might* be overwhelmed, but from my standpoint it seems like my family and I are being forced to *actually* suffer so that someone else *might* not. We keep being told to """"suck it up"""" but we've been doing everything *right* this whole time but the finish line keeps getting moved further and further away and we have reached our breaking point. Even my entire extended family is becoming quite extremist and it's scary. My uncles, aunts and cousins are turning anti-vax, crowing about 5G and Q-anon conspiracy theories and they are getting louder. These restrictions are causing something very ugly to bubble to the surface in our society. Please, we need your help to make our voices heard.
