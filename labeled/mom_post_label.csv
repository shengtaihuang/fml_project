Good afternoon, I am one of your constituents in Stittsville and wanted to write to you in order to inform you of at least one """"""""ground level"""""""" story of how the lockdowns are affecting the public. My family is struggling already and I don't know if another lockdown period is going to be sustainable. My wife and I both work for the federal government and have been rather unaffected by the lockdowns income-wise, luckily, however the school and other closures are taking a huge toll on my children. I have two in high school and one in grade 6 and all of them have seen their social circles evaporate in the past two years. The lockdown has hit them socially extremely hard as they struggled making friends beforehand, but now they all have none. I try to get them to enter other activities however everything is closed. Each time we start gaining momentum, we get the rug pulled out from under us. They have lost their drive and they are always sad. All have developed anxiety issues and are now seeing counsellors, their grades are suffering and we are struggling more and more to keep them moving forward in life. My eldest in particular has lost half of grade nine, all of grade 10 and it looks like all of grade 11. She will have lost her entire high school life and lost all social contacts being locked in her room by society order. I don't think that we can handle another lockdown. Several times a week we are consoling at least one of them as they cry themselves to sleep. My children NEED to be able to go to school and develop socially. We need help! To be clear I'm not an internet troll anti-vaxxer, we are all fully vaccinated. I fail to understand with all the research coming out that the omicron variant is far less serious than the original covid virus, why we are being pushed to the breaking point again. I know the story that the hospitals *might* be overwhelmed, but from my standpoint it seems like my family and I are being forced to *actually* suffer so that someone else *might* not. We keep being told to """"""""suck it up"""""""" but we've been doing everything *right* this whole time but the finish line keeps getting moved further and further away and we have reached our breaking point. Even my entire extended family is becoming quite extremist and it's scary. My uncles, aunts and cousins are turning anti-vax, crowing about 5G and Q-anon conspiracy theories and they are getting louder. These restrictions are causing something very ugly to bubble to the surface in our society. Please, we need your help to make our voices heard. Best Regards, Giles Babin and Family",,,,,,0,,,26,1.37,0

CEBU CITY, Philippines  Minors aged 15 years and below can now go out in Cebu City provided they are accompanied by fully vaccinated guardians. This was the pronouncement of Acting Mayor Michael Rama as signified in the new Directive 10-25-01 setting the guidelines for the implementation of the Alert Level 2 quarantine status in the city. Generally, the stay-at-home order remains for minors below 15 years old, senior citizens above 65 years old, and people with comorbidities or pre-existing medical conditions, except for obtaining essential goods and services, for work, and other permitted activities. Since the last Executive Order, senior citizens above 65 years old may already go out as long as they are fully vaccinated. This time, the Cebu City government has allowed minors below 15 years old to also enjoy the opening of more establishments in the city, and the policy also serves as a prelude to the eventual return of the face-to-face classes. Subject to other legal restrictions, minors and children who are below 15 years of age may be allowed in authorized establishments. Provided that they must be accompanied and supervised by a parent, guardian, or responsible adult. Minors need not be accompanied for purposes of obtaining essential goods and services, stated the directive. Furthermore, minors can enter authorized establishments such as indoor dining, as long as they are accompanied by a fully vaccinated guardian.",,,,,,0,,,6,-9,-1

If so, what inspired you to do so? Id love to hear from you! Personally, I dont have anti-vaccine parents, but I work to support teens that do, and I recently published an op-ed in the LA Times on this issue. Im the founder of VaxTeen, which was inspired by stories of teenagers with anti-vaccine parents turning to Reddit. Its website allows teens to determine what vaccines they need and when they can receive them without parental consent in their state. VaxTeen communicates directly with teenagers and young adults to educate them on the importance of vaccines and empower them to make well-informed decisions about their health.",,,,,,0,,,6,-0.57,0

Last year we did a long weekend in NH/ME for lobster rolls (yes, everywhere we went had good rolls). We did Philly on a cheese steak 'tour' (along with history and Reading terminal). We have also done lake George. Went to a town in MA for a restaurant we saw on DDD :) We need to get away and not sure where to go! Long weekend - leave Fri morning with no more than a 6hr drive. History a plus. No where that has vax mandates! No where local.....we want to really get away, explore, eat and relax!",,,,,,0,,,7,-5,1

It's a super cool space designed for parents and babies, but I wouldn't want to offer it if people are still hesitant. TIA!",,,,,,0,,,0,-30,0
