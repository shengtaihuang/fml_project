The truckers and their entourage were parking around the Cenotaph, prancing (and pissing) in the snow on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, waving Nazi flags, hanging an anti-vax post on the Terry Fox monument, mooching free meals from a soup kitchen, and screaming at the media covering the protest. This was a western super spreader event that will drive covid numbers up in Ontario. If this disgrace is not dealt with firmly, it could drive Canada towards anti-democratic illiberalism and the breakdown of public trust in its institutions. These truckers are not ordinary protesters, theyre hopeless. Protests have been premised on a simple principle: The government isnt living up to its own laws, or its laws undercut its claims of justice and fairness for all. The protest is intended to bring out thousands of people to shame the government into respecting its own proclaimed beliefs in justice, equality, freedom, the rule of law. These truckers have disregarded those principles. The reasons for their cross-country convoy morphed from day to day, hour to hour. Freedom from vaccination vanished; now it was the whole public health response that had to go, and never mind that the federal government cant much influence the provinces on such issues. Then a strange alliance of the Governor-General and the Senate was supposed to oust Justin Trudeau and then what? Hand the country over to the truckers? These truckers and their organizers dont seem to have a very clear sense of any kind of history. They did know that swastikas trigger people, like a thumbtack on the teachers chair. They wanted to own us, get a rise out of us, by telling us how little they shared of our values. Weve seen this show evolve six years ago south of the border. Trump could insult and undermine American institutions, and persuade Americans that some weird Deep State had taken over their country, from the media to the FBI to the electoral system. He didnt have to marshal arguments, cite authorities, or otherwise try to persuade skeptics. You could just dump on anyone who didnt agree with you. There was no logic and he gave America hate as a faith. So the truckers and their supporters have behaved very badly to challenge Canadians who respect and trust in their institutions. You admire Terry Fox? We couldnt care less. You respect our fallen soldiers? Piss on them. Youre in the media? We dont need to give you a sound bite about what we want  just a few seconds of abusing you as a stooge of a lying newspaper or broadcaster. The same disrespect went out to every healthcare worker, every teacher, and every civil servant. Make their jobs harder, push them to burn out and quit so the hospitals and schools and governments cant function as well. No one knows whats true anymore, which is a precondition for fascism. The Freedom Convoy, then, is a deliberate provocation, a test of the municipal and federal governments: Well show you what we think of you and your sacred institutions. Now, what are you going to do about it? Trudeau senior would have said Just watch me, and called in the army. Jagmeet Singh has confined himself to severe disapproval of vile, violent and hateful behaviour. The truckers have also effectively neutered the Conservative Party of Canada. Erin OToole could neither reject them nor endorse them, just as he couldnt come out for or against vaccination. Meanwhile, Maxime Berniers Peoples Party of Canada was in the thick of it and likely signing up plenty of members. Our governments seem to have made a disastrous misjudgment. Where the truckers and their supporters are violating laws, they should be promptly arrested. These arrests should continue as long as needed and it would show Canada and the world that were serious about peace, order and good government and public health as well. Justice delayed is justice denied for such people. Worse yet, justice is both denied and discredited for the rest of us.",,,,,,0,,,11,-3.91,-1

There is a story that a Roman aristocrat opened the gates of Rome to the Visigoths in 410AD. He did it because this was the third siege of Rome that he had endured and he didnt want to do it anymore. Now there is a lot of fog with that story but it does make a great point. We are becoming as a nation a lot like Rome. We have been on top for a while and figure that we no longer have to work for our place. We see it in the Karens of the world and their male counterparts, the Teds. We see drama everywhere for everything and so much of it is fake BS. But they get away with it so others follow in their footsteps and the media gives them notoriety for it. The national symbol should be that for Narcissism because that is what we are now about. The entire anti-vax movement and resistance to getting a shot is so much like the Roman aristocrat. I just dont want to be bothered! . But the one that borders on malignant Narcissism is how Joe Biden is being blamed for inflation. There is a whole lot of insanity (Narcissism) at work here. Before economics went Voodoo with Reagan and both parties fell in lockstep to protect it, there was real economics. During the pandemic, many of us bought way more things than we have ever before. Amazon was some kind of therapy because so many were deprived of their constant interaction and their phone wasnt good enough. So they bought everything under the sun. Now into the second and third years of this pandemic, we still are. We buy the vast majority of it from China and it has to be paid for. The oil cartel has taken advantage of it to screw us to the wall, every business is raising prices well beyond their costs and for that reason they are bringing in, record profits. I REPEAT THEY ARE MAKING RECORD PROFITS!!!. And yet in so many Karen and Ted minds, it is beyond them to figure this out. The media makes sure everyone knows who to blame and GOP/ Con politicians make sure too. But this is not the government at work here, it is what we have allowed as a faux monopoly economy at work here. . Societies usually have ebbs and flows. We are going through a hell of an ebb right now. But its not just that, which is so scary. Its that smart people are so easily misled while readily apparent facts go unseen, discarded, and ignored. THAT! That is what is so scary. That stupid and self-centered rules and it is right there to be seen in the media, every night and day. If we cannot stop this fall into self-centered stupidity, then we are indeed doomed. RC Romine",,,,,,0,,,2,-0.83,0

I'm so tired of the """"""""fake virus, fake squad"""""""" posts pushing dumb conspiracies.. Just as tired of hearing that Trump sucks. This page shouldn't be a bitchfest or anti-vax medium used to push conspiracies. Let's exchange real ideas and share valid information. Here's my take: I think that regardless of how deadly Covid may or may not be- It is what it is. Our own government in both parties has crippled our means to survive and won't help us otherwise. How do we go forward? As for me I'd rather not take my chances and be wrong- just as global warming and dumping my trash in the ocean may not be as bad as many claim- I'm still going to try my best to take care of them.. As for """"""""shitty, fake, sellout AOC"""""""" voting for Pelosi.. Let's walk this through shall we? If not Pelosi, then who? Someone worse most likely. There are about less than 10 progressives among 100's of centrist assholes. Sure, it would have been a symbolic """"""""fuck you"""""""", but there wasn't going to be anyone else for speaker. We already know how spiteful the establishment is- do you really think there would have been a better outcome? As far as forcing an M4A vote- it would get shot down. And then centrists would use that over and over and over again as """"""""proof"""""""" that the people don't want it. And some handfuls of boommeriffic Karenesque dolts would buy into it- reinforcing the b.s. echo chamber of the establishment who's brainwashed them and making the next vote, and the next even harder. We need to vote more progressives in first. We do not have a large enough coalition yet. Sorry but that's the truth. I'm in government myself. I'm small potatoes but as a board member on parks and rec in a very small, conservative town I need to be very careful with my ideas, how I present them and who to or they WILL railroad me. I'm in secret talks with other """"""""downlow progressives"""""""" in my town who get it. We can't install a """"""""homeless shower"""""""" in our public park because 90% of our government would freak out that we communists are using taxpayer money to fund a homeless sanctuary.. so we sell the idea to the rest of the board as a """"""""much requested amenity by the boaters who pay for our parking and launch fees, thereby increasing revenue"""""""" etc.. It's bullshit, yeah.. but it's how things work here. Until we help more of us get elected to more posts, our power is limited. Our strength is in our numbers and also our knowledge of the process. Imo, based on my own actual, real world government experience as a 3 year appointed official, it's way way too early to write off any of the few progressive leaders we so desperately need right now. I highly encourage anyone reading this to sit in on some of their city council meetings that are open to the public- and better yet, go for an open seat on a committee.. because many of you literally have absolutely 0 clue how government or the process works. It's not easy. I am 20 to 25% of a vote that deals with things that can cost my small town 6 or more figures. That last vote I had to choose between additional $180k night lighting for a baseball field (where most of our adult council members are huge night baseball fans) or to refurbish the only children's playground in town and the only place for poor families and young kids to hang out. I was the only vote for the playground, the other members voted to add more lights to our already illuminated field. They were not happy with my vote and they still got their stupid, wastefull, unnecessary lights anyway. Because of my votes they may not want me on the committee when my term expires.. I don't know. But the point is you don't either. I'm not yet ready to write AOC off.",,,,,,0,,,28,-1.43,0

I am not going to take this recall attempt lying down. I'm going to fight because there's too much at stake in this moment. And today, I am asking you to join me: Please add your name to say you oppose the far-right Republican recall effort in California. It is critical you make your voice heard from the start of this effort. First and foremost, I need you to know I am not going to be distracted from the critical work we have to move us forward in California. That means getting more vaccines in people's arms, more people back to work, and more kids back in the classroom. But that means I need your help defeating this recall effort. And let's call it what it is: it's a partisan, Republican recall -- backed by the RNC, anti-mask and anti-vax extremists, and pro-Trump forces who want to overturn the last election and have opposed much of what we have done to fight the pandemic. If they are successful, it would mean risking the progress we are making to end the pandemic. We can't let that happen. California cannot afford to be sidetracked by partisan political games. So we'll fight this recall for the reason I am fighting to get every Californian vaccinated -- because ending this pandemic as quickly as possible is too important to get delayed by Trump loyalists and far right-wing Republicans. But I cannot do that alone. Add your name: say you oppose the Republican recall effort in California. This is important. Thank you for joining me in this effort.

Stevie Nicks wrote a song about her experience with abuse, The Chain. But the lyric that tells the tale is You would never break the chain (Never break the chain) That is indeed the situation we find ourselves in. . This is not necessarily a story of good and bad. But it is one of winners and losers in the Reagan Revolution and the Cons takeover of the economy. The Cons themselves are bad, they have driven this nation into an authoritarian disaster. But those that went with the Reagan Revolution simply see themselves as those that were smart enough to go with the flow and thrived from it. They are so tied into the abuse of the lower and middle class that they see it as their due. They see economic segregation as simply the way of the world, they see the off-shoring of American jobs as others wanting too much. Even though there is no limit to what they want. As it becomes more and more apparent that they screwed the pooch, we see and more of the Karen and Ted effect. Its not about greed and its aftermath, its about freedom and themselves being exploited by poor people. Its really about Narcissism and the faith that they can never be wrong, especially when they are. So Trump was no aberration, he is simply the norm to them. . What is now Trumpism has always been here. Its about seeing the world through the prism of greed and selfishness. That everyone else is wrong, socialists, communists looking to take away everything from them. Taxes are the wages of governmental sin, God is with them because, and of course God is. The Karens and Teds see themselves as righteous winners, no matter how much they screw up OUR nation. We should really have no surprise when the anti-vaxers showed up because they are just Karens and Teds looking for a cause to preach to others. Right or wrong, it doesnt matter. Its all about them anyway. Anti-vax was just there and available. In so many households in America, particularly in the upper-middle class, it is the Karen and Ted show. Their much-deserved wealth and winner status is dissolving as the corporations become more and more greedy. Their life on credit is balancing on a pin, their lifestyles and image are all wrapped up into their illusion. Their 401k, is simply a con and so they make sure to vote for anyone that will protect the con and their illusion. If democracy dies, if the poor people suffer, then so be it. As long as the police can keep it under control. Abuse is the name of the game and they are vested in its image, things, and politics. . Keeping it going is all they can do. They live to retire and live in luxury. If they can just keep the Dems and the progressives/ socialists out. That somehow with Republicans in charge of swing state government they were cheated! Their 401k will die along with their image and dreams. The chain of economic, social, and political abuse must be kept intact for them to thrive. Going to church substitutes for morals, their ass in the pew makes it all right. Have to keep it all going or the world I need will die. The Karens and Teds, the fragile that need to abuse others to be happy and whole. This is what narcissism is all about. They deserve to abuse, to have things to show the world they are special, superior. The Cons game of thrones is all there is. The lies and message give reason to their need to abuse, their Karens and Teds screaming and shaking, blaming everyone for their actions is what they have become. Just like Donald Trump, they are winners, the privileged, and the protected. It is time to quit letting them get away with it! RC Romine",,,,,,0,,,2,-0.83,0

It is ironic that the Union Plan to strangle the South through blockade was called the Anaconda Plan. Because the Cons (Rich Ultra Conservative Authoritarians) are acting like a python to squeeze democracy to death, before they swallow it. . You can hear the ribs cracking now if you listen, if you ignore the media Infotainment and the Cons Fox New propaganda machine. Democracy is being crushed to death before they swallow it whole. Already the opposition to it are being named and characterized as some sort of criminal or something to fear. Ownership of information, the destruction of truth, logic-based decision making, and ethics are being squeezed into ruin. You can see it if you look beyond the semi-truth we are given and to the forces causing it. This is nothing less than a cold civil war, for the soul of America. . Lets begin with a discussion of rights and the abuse of the concept of sacrosanct rights. There is a bubble around all of us that we own as human beings. That is what rights are. That bubble is the area we control around us. But here is where the Cons and Regressives arguments fall apart. From policing to abortion, the Cons and Regressives work as hard as they can to penetrate that three feet bubble that we own, that is our real right. Their lie is even more exposed, as being complete bullshit by their arguments about abortion, and education, masks, and vaccine. Because their actions go well beyond that 3 feet bubble and look to purposefully invade your space, your rights while claiming there are perfectly protected. From their ownership of the media and control of content to their out-and-out propaganda machine, they seek to invade your 3 feet bubble. Their screams and yells, reinforce by intimidation and violence are nothing more than the rants of authoritarians, seeking control of your space, freedoms. . The anti-maskers and anti-vax people simply are looking to take away your freedoms for their comfort. They seek to control your space, your mind as they do the Base of racists and the authoritarian-minded. Free-thinkers are dangerous! Because the existing Abuse Culture demands people to fit into a certain perception of things. In a slightly different way as seen in 1984 and other dystopian books. That is why they enable their most ardent of fools to enforce for them, the intrusion into our private space with intimidation and violence. They seek to enable, much like the Communists to have neighbors denounce neighbors except to have those neighbors shoot you and the police do nothing. Those that defend their 3 feet, become the enemy. Those that willingly give up, are rewarded with peace. Those that enforce it are given things to prove their loyalty. This is the python squeezing the life out of our nation, our democracy. . We must begin by defending our 3 feet bubble. But as with a python, we must remember that you can chop up the body and it may eventually die, but to kill a python before it kills democracy, as the old saying goes, you must cut off its head.

Can you show us Brad's vaccination card? -Um... -And also, can you provide me with proof that Brad is not a carrier of HIV, Hepatitis A or B, or any other communicable diseases? Same for you and the kitchen staff. -Um... -Also, we would prefer not to be served by someone who is on or uses recreational drugs such as marijuana, cocaine, meth, fentanyl, etc, so if you could provide us with Brad's most recent tox screen, that would be great. Matter of fact, I'm going to need to see all of your employees medical history. -Um... Let me get the manager for you. -That would be great, thanks.

They are simply bitter and desperate because independent media and free-form platforms not driven by a corporatist agenda are rapidly shrinking their influence, I heard CBS news report that Neil Young wants to remove his music off of Spotify because of vax misinformation spread by conservative podcaster Joe Rogan Young, nor those who agree with him have much of anything to say when the legacy/cable media lie on the regular. Only someone who has never listened to that podcast would refer to Joe Rogan as conservative. Last I checked, conservatives dont openly advocate for UBI programs and Medicare For All or allow Bernie Sanders to speak freely for over 90 minutes. . . but in this day and age, if you think that everyone should be able to share their perspective freely as laid out by the Constitution, that alone makes you conservative - or the enemy to the most dedicated legacy media disciples. Actually, my impression is that most people who criticize the JRE podcast have never heard it because they so often criticize something said by a guest as something said by JR and then say he and his show should be censored. I can remember a time, not 20 years ago when the left was shouting in opposition to the government and the right was telling everyone to shut up lol. If you think an idea is bad, challenge it with a better one because crying for censorship isnt and has never been the right answer.",,,,,,0,,,16,-2.69,1

I promise to seldom post, but I have a thought to put before you. I have had interactions with a number of people who seem entitled and privileged but seem to wish to affect otherwise. To explain, these are seeming social justice warriors who are acrimonious and can't seem to form coalitions to achieve meaningful change. To explain, they might march in Black Lives Protest events but seem intent on making their march more about getting attention for themselves. In the specific example I have mind, a so called advocate for LGBT issues was being told to shut up by actual LGBT people because they were being insulted by her presumption and intolerance. I suspect there is a form of SJW who is like a narcissistic human version of the cuckoo bird. (Short version, the bird puts its eggs in the nests of other birds and her chicks push the other eggs out of the best.) So, I am not an African American. I support their cause and needs, but I want to give them support as opposed to inserting myself. My ego doesn't need to be on the screen. However, some white people seem to be attacking a successful female black lawyer who was chosen for VP. This is what inexplicable if they care about the issues in a way that needs concrete change. On any liberal issue. Joe isn't Trump and Kamala isn't Pence. Healthcare, MeToo, BLM, police brutality, affordable college, social security, welfare, and appropriate COVID response. On any liberal issue the choice for President is Joe/Kamala vs Trump/Pence. Any attack on Joe/Kamala should be phrased in such a way to point out that Trump/Pence is a better choice. No false choice. This is the actual choice at this point. On no liberal point I know of is Trump a better choice than Joe. So the """"""""Warriors"""""""" aren't loyal to any particular cause. Certainly, they are not loyal to the Democratic Party. You might suggest they are loyal to their Prophet, Bernie, but he has said explicitly for his followers to support Joe. There is no, apparent, explanation for their aversion to Joe in the current context. Their actual goals are an indecipherable mystery. They are no more responsive to reason or discussion than an anti-vax or anti-mask conspiracy theorist. Their minds are, so far as I can tell, inscrutable. Quite possibly, they have formed some odd addiction to arguing and being an outsider that being angry and ranting is, actually, their only divisive goal. Some emotional compulsion requires them to dig in come whatever may. And here is the important point (thanks for humoring me) because the actual results don't really matter. They exist in a state of Privilege where if, say, a black man has his neck knelt upon by a cop while saying """"""""I can't breathe"""""""" as being filmed with several of his buddies standing by doing nothing to preserve the life of an American citizen *it doesn't matter enough to them that this happens to stop arguing and defeat Trump so actual change of any sort can possibly happen to improve the situation.* Essentially, I suspect the very worst racists who are most responsible for systemic racism may actually attend Black Lives Matter marches.",,,,,,0,,,20,-1.25,0
